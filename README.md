## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've applied the knoledges that I've been learning from previously challenges. In this project, the concepts of Flexbox, Grid, Mobile First and BEM were applied much faster than before. My evolution is going well and I'm very proud of it.

### Continued development

Next step is to continue with the challenges, learn and apply Javascript and in the future is to learn libraries and frameworks.
